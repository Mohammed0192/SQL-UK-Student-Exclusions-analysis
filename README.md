# Project Background
The Department for Education has yet commit policies addressing the alarming growth in UK student suspensions across primary and secondary education. Since students have returned to in-person education post-2020, schools across the UK have been issuing suspensions and permenant exclusions exponentially. The Department for Education have released census based data on suspensions/exclusions and school workforce size for regions across the UK.

The dominant theory is that teachers and staff are underequipped to handle poorly socialised children returning to mainstream education. This project analyses the UK education census data from 2016 - 2023 to understand what key factors dictate differences in exclusion rates across the UK after the 2019-20 academic year.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Student Free School Meal Eligibility Analysis:** Analysing the average number of students being excluded based on Free School Meals eligibility as a socio-economic indicator
- **Regional Comparisons:** Evaluation of exclusion data based on region
- **Number of Teaching Assistants per School:**  Assessing the impact that Teaching Assistants have on student exclusion rates

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The companies main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: table1, table2, table3, table4, with a total row count of X records. A description of each table is as follows:
- **Table 2:**
- **Table 3:**
- **Table 4:**
- **Table 5:**

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
